# Quiz‑App

❓**Quiz App (Vite + React + Tailwind CSS)** A responsive quiz web app built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me gain hands‑on experience with React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`, plus simple state management for tracking current question and score. Users can select from multiple-choice questions, answer against a timer, view their final score, and restart the quiz.
